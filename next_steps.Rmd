# Potential Project Next Steps
* Refine station locations
* Adjust corridor to include downtown intermodal site, perhaps adding 1 alternate route
* Compare MPO land use data for base year to ACS/Census for reasonableness check
* Complete documentation on this site, perhaps adding technical documentation page
* Potentially add page describing TOD thresholds and include graphics from FDOT report
* Potentially incorporate output from TOD Readiness application, which in some respects provides more comprehensive station evaluation

# Potential Methadology Enhancements
* Enhance disaggregation methodology (using parcel or building footprint data)
* Add additional indicators contained in TOD guidebook (jobs-housing)
* Complete documentation on this site
* Improve graphics and potentially make them interactive
